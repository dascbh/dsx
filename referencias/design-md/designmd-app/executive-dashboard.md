## Overview

Design an executive dashboard. Ideal for landing pages, modern websites. AI-ready template. Executive dashboards exist because CEOs don't analyze data — they consume signals. The distinction matters. An analyst dashboard is a workspace: filters, drill-downs, forty charts competing for attention. An executive dashboard is a verdict. Three numbers. Maybe five. Green or red. Done.

This pattern crystallized in the 2010s when mobile-first thinking forced designers to ask: what if the viewer has exactly six seconds? Turns out, that's generous for most C-suite interactions. The 'glanceable' philosophy isn't dumbing things down — it's respecting that a CEO's job is decision-making, not data exploration. They need the answer, not the journey.

The best executive dashboards borrow more from editorial design than from BI tools. Think magazine covers, not spreadsheets. A single dominant metric anchors the hierarchy. Supporting figures provide context without demanding attention. Everything else lives one tap away, for the rare moment someone actually wants to dig deeper.

- **Style:** BI/Analytics
- **Keywords:** High-level KPIs, large key metrics, minimal detail, summary view, trend indicators, at-a-glance insights, executive summary
- **Era:** 2020s Modern
- **Light/Dark:** ✓ Full / ✓ Full

## Colors

- Palette derived from style keywords and era context


## Typography

- **Display / Hero:** System UI stack (-apple-system, sans-serif) — Weight 700, tight tracking, used for headline impact
- **Body:** System UI stack (-apple-system, sans-serif) — Weight 400, 16px/1.6 line-height, max 72ch per line
- **UI Labels / Captions:** System UI stack (-apple-system, sans-serif) — 0.875rem, weight 500, slight letter-spacing
- **Monospace:** JetBrains Mono — Used for code, metadata, and technical values

Scale:
- Hero: clamp(2.5rem, 5vw, 4rem)
- H1: 2.25rem
- H2: 1.5rem
- Body: 1rem / 1.6
- Small: 0.875rem


## Layout

- **Grid:** CSS Grid primary. Max-width containment: 1280px centered with 1.5rem side padding.
- **Spacing rhythm:** Balanced. Base unit: 0.5rem (8px).
- **Section vertical gaps:** clamp(4rem, 8vw, 8rem).
- **Hero layout:** Split-screen (text left, visual right).
- **Feature sections:** Zig-zag alternating text+image rows. No 3-equal-columns.
- **Mobile collapse:** All multi-column layouts collapse below 768px. No horizontal overflow.
- **z-index contract:** base (0) / sticky-nav (100) / overlay (200) / modal (300) / toast (500).


## Elevation & Depth

KPI value animations (count-up), trend arrow direction animations, metric card hover lift, alert pulse effect

- **Physics:** Spring — stiffness 120, damping 20. Confident, weighted transitions.
- **Entry animations:** Fade + translate-Y (16px → 0) over 480ms ease-out. Staggered cascades for lists: 100ms between items.
- **Hover states:** Scale(1.03) + shadow lift over 200ms.
- **Page transitions:** Fade + slide (300ms).
- **Performance:** Only transform and opacity animated. No layout-triggering properties.


## Shapes

Base corner radius: 8px. See rounded tokens in front matter for the full scale.


## Components

- **Primary Button:** Subtly rounded (0.5rem) shape. Accent color fill. Hover: 8% darken + subtle lift shadow. Active: -1px translate tactile press. Font weight 600. No outer glows.
- **Secondary / Ghost Button:** Outline variant. 1.5px border in muted color. Text in primary color. Hover: subtle background fill.
- **Cards:** Subtly rounded (0.5rem) corners. Surface background. Subtle shadow (0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)). 1px border stroke.

- **Navigation:** Primary surface background. Active item: accent color indicator. Font weight 500 when active.
- **Skeletons:** Shimmer animation matching component dimensions. No circular spinners.
- **Empty States:** Icon-based composition with descriptive text and action button.


## Do's and Don'ts

- No decorative gradients — flat color only
- No shadows heavier than 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)
- No pure black (#000000) — use off-black or charcoal variants
- No oversaturated accent colors (saturation cap: 80%)
- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do KPIs 4-6 maximum
- Do Trends visible
- Do Status colors clear
- Do One-page view
- Do Mobile simplified
- Do Print-friendly layout
