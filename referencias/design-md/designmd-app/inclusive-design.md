## Overview

Design for universal accessibility: high contrast (7:1+), large text (16px+), keyboard-only navigation, screen reader optimization, WCAG AAA compliance, symbol-based color indicators (not color-only), haptic feedback, voice interaction support, reduced motion options. Ideal for landing pages, saas. AI-ready template. Microsoft's Inclusive Design toolkit, released around 2016, changed how our industry talked about disability. Instead of framing accessibility as a checklist you grudgingly complete before launch, it introduced the permanent-temporary-situational spectrum. A person with one arm, someone holding a baby, a developer with a broken wrist: same design problem. That reframe mattered. It gave designers permission to care about this stuff without needing a compliance officer breathing down their neck.

Then came the lawsuits. Domino's Pizza. Beyoncé's website. Thousands of ADA cases filed every year. Companies started paying attention, but often for the wrong reasons. The curb-cut effect proved the business case anyway: captions help people in noisy rooms, high contrast helps everyone outdoors, keyboard navigation helps power users. Designing for the edges improves the center.

By 2026, inclusive design isn't a differentiator. It's table stakes. If your component library doesn't ship with focus management, skip links, and reduced motion support baked in, you're shipping broken software. Full stop.

- **Style:** Accessible, Inclusive, Clear, Universal
- **Keywords:** Accessible, color-blind friendly, high contrast, haptic feedback, voice interaction, screen reader, WCAG AAA, universal
- **Era:** Universal
- **Light/Dark:** ✓ Full / ✓ Full

## Colors

- Palette derived from style keywords and era context


## Typography

- **Display / Hero:** System UI stack (-apple-system, sans-serif) — Weight 700, tight tracking, used for headline impact
- **Body:** System UI stack (-apple-system, sans-serif) — Weight 400, 16px/1.6 line-height, max 72ch per line
- **UI Labels / Captions:** System UI stack (-apple-system, sans-serif) — 0.875rem, weight 500, slight letter-spacing
- **Monospace:** JetBrains Mono — Used for code, metadata, and technical values

Scale:
- Hero: clamp(2.5rem, 5vw, 4rem)
- H1: 2.25rem
- H2: 1.5rem
- Body: 1rem / 1.6
- Small: 0.875rem


## Layout

- **Grid:** CSS Grid primary. Max-width containment: 1280px centered with 1.5rem side padding.
- **Spacing rhythm:** Balanced. Base unit: 0.5rem (8px).
- **Section vertical gaps:** clamp(4rem, 8vw, 8rem).
- **Hero layout:** Split-screen (text left, visual right).
- **Feature sections:** Zig-zag alternating text+image rows. No 3-equal-columns.
- **Mobile collapse:** All multi-column layouts collapse below 768px. No horizontal overflow.
- **z-index contract:** base (0) / sticky-nav (100) / overlay (200) / modal (300) / toast (500).


## Elevation & Depth

Haptic feedback (vibration), voice guidance, focus indicators (4px+ ring), motion options, alt content, semantic

- **Physics:** Spring — stiffness 120, damping 20. Confident, weighted transitions.
- **Entry animations:** Fade + translate-Y (16px → 0) over 480ms ease-out. Staggered cascades for lists: 100ms between items.
- **Hover states:** Scale(1.03) + shadow lift over 200ms.
- **Page transitions:** Fade + slide (300ms).
- **Performance:** Only transform and opacity animated. No layout-triggering properties.


## Shapes

Base corner radius: 8px. See rounded tokens in front matter for the full scale.


## Components

- **Primary Button:** Subtly rounded (0.5rem) shape. Accent color fill. Hover: 8% darken + subtle lift shadow. Active: -1px translate tactile press. Font weight 600. No outer glows.
- **Secondary / Ghost Button:** Outline variant. 1.5px border in muted color. Text in primary color. Hover: subtle background fill.
- **Cards:** Subtly rounded (0.5rem) corners. Surface background. Subtle shadow (0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)). 1px border stroke.
- **Inputs:** Label above input. 1px border stroke. Focus ring: 2px accent color offset 2px. Error text below in semantic red. No floating labels.
- **Navigation:** Primary surface background. Active item: accent color indicator. Font weight 500 when active.
- **Skeletons:** Shimmer animation matching component dimensions. No circular spinners.
- **Empty States:** Icon-based composition with descriptive text and action button.


## Do's and Don'ts

- No emojis in UI — use icon system only (Lucide, Heroicons)
- No pure black (#000000) — use off-black or charcoal variants
- No oversaturated accent colors (saturation cap: 80%)
- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do WCAG AAA verified
- Do 7:1+ contrast all text
- Do Keyboard accessible (Tab/Enter)
- Do Screen reader tested
- Do Focus visible 3-4px
- Do No color-only indicators
- Do Haptic fallback
